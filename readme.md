# Node Docker Demo

This is a simple application to demonstrate using Docker for local NodeJS app development. It uses Node v9, Express, Sequelize and Postgres for data storage, and Handlebars for views.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker 17.0+](https://docker.com)

## Quickstart

- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/karllhughes/node-docker-demo.git`
  - Note: The `master` branch has all the Docker-related files included, while the `start-here` branch does not. If you plan on doing the tutorial written for Javascript January, use the `start-here` branch, but if you want something that works right away, use the `master` branch.
- Make sure Docker is running and that you're using version 17+ by running: `docker -v`
- Run `docker build -t node-docker .` to build a local version of the image.
- Start a postgres database container _before_ you start the application: `docker run -d --rm -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=admin -v $(pwd)/.data:/var/lib/postgresql/data -v $(pwd)/sql:/sql --name nd-db postgres:9.6`
  - Wait a few seconds for the database to boot up before running any queries on it, especially if this is your first time running the application.
- If it's your first time, run the migrations to create the database table: `docker exec nd-db psql admin admin -f /sql/migrations.sql`
- You can also seed the database with dummy date using: `docker exec nd-db psql admin admin -f /sql/seeds.sql`
- Now you can run the application using Docker: `docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -d -v $(pwd)/app:/src/app -v $(pwd)/public:/src/public --link nd-db --name nd-app node-docker`
- Check that the containers are running by typing `docker ps` and then navigating to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.
- To shut the application down, enter the command `docker stop nd-app nd-db`

If you're new to Docker, be sure to read the complete tutorial for explanations behind the Docker commands used.
